===== Diffie-Hillman =====
g=11, p=59
A = 57 = g^X mod p. With a python for loop, I found that 11^36 mod 59 = 57, so X = 36.
B = 44 = g^Y mod p. With a python for loop, I found that 11^15 mod 59 = 44, so Y = 15.
This step would not be feasible with larger numbers, because it is essentially guess and check. 

A^Y mod p = 57^15 mod 59 = 36
B^X mod p = 44^36 mod 59 = 36

Therefore, the shared secret is 36.

===== RSA =====
See eve.py for the code I used for this.
For each number m in the message, I looped through integers until I found an x such that
m = x^13 mod 5561. This step would not be feasible with larger numbers. Then, I converted each x to an ASCII character.
The resulting decrypted message is:

Hey Bob. It's even worse than we thought! Your pal, Alice. https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/04/airtags-are-used-for-stalking-far-more-than-previously-reported.html
